# OpenTelemetryDotNet
A small POC project to showcase instrumentation of a Net 6+ application with OpenTelemetry.  This is just an educational experiment and is not meant to represent a production-ready environment.  

There are many ways to instrument this tooling. I will do my best to update this README.md to describe the overall approach.
